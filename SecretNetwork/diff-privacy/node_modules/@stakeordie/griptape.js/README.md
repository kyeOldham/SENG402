# Griptape.js

Griptape.js is a framework to rapidly develop Secret Network DApps.

## Why Griptape

Griptape is an essential part of the skate setup. Not only provides the traction necessary to keep your foot on the
board, but it helps when doing advance stuff like tricks: the real focus of most skaters.

While developing Dapps, we found a lot of patterns and good practices that can help you quickly get your application up
and running and start focusing on what your application has to do. We call it griptape because is the layer that helps
with all the core of your app; it helps you get off the ground.
